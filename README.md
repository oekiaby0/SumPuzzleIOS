# SumPuzzle iOS App

Welcome to the SumPuzzle iOS App! This game is inspired by Sumplete, a logic-based number game. In SumPuzzle, you'll solve puzzles by using your logical deduction skills to figure out which numbers to keep (green) and which to delete (red) while ensuring that the sum in each row and column matches its corresponding "sum clue."

## How to Play

1. **Grid Layout**: You'll start with a grid of cells, each initially in an "unknown" state.

2. **Sum Clues**: Each row and column has a "sum clue" associated with it, indicating the total sum of the numbers in that row or column.

3. **Marking Cells**:
   - To mark a cell as "deleted" (red), tap or click on it once.
   - To mark a cell as "kept" (green), tap or click on it again.
   - Tap or click once more to reset the cell to the "unknown" state.
   - You can also tap the sum clue of a row or column to mark the whole row or column as "kept".

4. **Solving Puzzles**: Your goal is to strategically identify which numbers to delete and which to keep in each row and column to ensure that the sum matches the given "sum clue."

5. **Winning**: Once you successfully remove the correct numbers and meet all the sum clues, the sum totals on the right and bottom of the grid will light up.
